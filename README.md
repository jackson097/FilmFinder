Before starting the server, first activate a virtual environment by entering <b>./env/scripts/activate</b> in your command line.
The virtual environment will ensure that the project dependencies are consistent so users dont have to worry about having incomplete dependencies. 
Once activated, go into the "src" folder by entering <b>cd src</b> and enter <b>python manage.py runserver</b> into the command line. Once complete, look in the command line
for the URL the server is being run at, usually its http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
